# Material Muted Yellow

A dark - yellow / orange based theme inspired by material design!
This theme has borderless windows in vscode and non obstrusive colors in the editor, while still being readable.

## Why another "Material Theme"?
Because i did not like the font colors. They were often too aggressive to me, like using aggressive reds and so on.
This theme tries to keep the sleekiness of material themes, while also using a nice combination on font colors that are compatible with the overall yellow touches.
